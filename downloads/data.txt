    description:Today I had the scariest yet most exciting realization. In one month from now I will be moving back home to the Chicago area to complete 6 months of clinicals at two of the most renowned hospitals in Chicago before I enter the real world as an occupational therapist. 6 years of long hours studying my butt off, living in a different state than my family, friends, and boyfriend, and being pushed out of my comfort zone has lead me to this moment. This journey of becoming an occupational therapist has filled my life with so many wonderful people and mentors- all whom I am thankful for. It is crazy to think that in one short month we will all be going our separate ways to embark on new adventures while changing people's lives in so many ways. üíï

    description:Day 1 #YogaPropPop 
BLOCK

Welcome to Day 1! This is how this challenge works. We give you the prop to work with and you get to pick the pose. We will all be giving different ideas on how to use the ‚ÄúProp of the Day‚Äù You can choose one of our ideas, or come up with one of your own!! Also if you don‚Äôt own the prop we are using, there are always other items you can use instead!
üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶üì¶
I chose a shoulder, underarm, lat opener that I use often to stretch & work this area of the body.  Since many of us sit all day at a computer this is a good counter stretch to incorporate.  And you can do it with a table or a wall. 
If you don‚Äôt have any yoga blocks you can get creative with whatever you have!!
Be safe and have fun!!!

I chose forearm because I find it so challenging for my shoulders & upper back & the fact that I can get my head off the ground in it 70% of the time is amazing! Do what's right for your body!
